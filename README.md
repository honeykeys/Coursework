# Coursework
I've added some relevant coursework (not sure if I will keep these on here for too long!) to my profile.

### Oracle Database

The first is a piece of coursework where I had to design and implement an Oracle Database. I created an Oracle container on my Linux partition so I could execute queries offline (the rest of my class was using a remote server, which was riddled with issues).

### WiFi-Trace

In my thesis, I discuss refactoring a Python CLI Contact Tracing Application as a web-service using Google Cloud Platform.
